To merge the changes from the master branch into the main branch, follow these steps:

1. Switch to the main Branch
If the main branch doesn't exist yet, create it and switch to it:

git checkout -b main
If the main branch already exists, simply switch to it:

git checkout main
2. Merge master into main
Run the following command to merge changes from master into main:


git merge master
This will integrate all the changes from master into the main branch. If there are conflicts, resolve them manually, then stage and commit the resolved files.

3. Push the main Branch to Remote
After merging, push the main branch to the remote repository:

git push -u origin main
